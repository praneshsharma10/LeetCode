This solution uses the **sliding window technique** with a `HashSet` to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation:

### Key Components:
1. **Input Conversion**:
   - The string `s` is converted into a character array `Array` using `s.toCharArray()`. This allows easy access to each character by index.

2. **HashSet**:
   - The `HashSet<Character>` named `charSet` is used to store unique characters of the current substring.
   - It ensures there are no duplicate characters in the current window.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The sliding window is defined by two pointers, `i` (start of the window) and `j` (end of the window).
   - `i` adjusts to remove duplicates and shrink the window when necessary.
   - `j` iterates through the array, extending the window.

4. **Tracking Maximum Length**:
   - `maxLength` keeps track of the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i = 0`: Start of the window.
   - `maxLength = 0`: Maximum length of substring found so far.
   - `charSet`: Empty `HashSet`.

2. **Iterating through the Array**:
   - For each character at index `j` in `Array`, perform the following:
     - **Check for Duplicates**:
       - If `currentChar` (character at `Array[j]`) is already in `charSet`, it means the substring has a duplicate.
       - Use a `while` loop to remove characters starting from `i` until the duplicate is removed.
       - Increment `i` to shrink the window.
     - **Add Current Character**:
       - Add `currentChar` to `charSet` since it's now part of the valid substring.
     - **Update Maximum Length**:
       - Calculate the current substring length as `j - i + 1` (distance between the two pointers + 1).
       - Update `maxLength` to the larger value between `maxLength` and `j - i + 1`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all characters, return `maxLength`.

### Example Execution:
#### Input:
`s = "abcabcbb"`

#### Steps:
1. `Array = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'b']`
2. `i = 0, maxLength = 0, charSet = {}`

- **Step 1 (`j = 0`, `currentChar = 'a'`)**:
  - `'a'` not in `charSet`. Add `'a'`.
  - `charSet = {'a'}`, `maxLength = 1`.

- **Step 2 (`j = 1`, `currentChar = 'b'`)**:
  - `'b'` not in `charSet`. Add `'b'`.
  - `charSet = {'a', 'b'}`, `maxLength = 2`.

- **Step 3 (`j = 2`, `currentChar = 'c'`)**:
  - `'c'` not in `charSet`. Add `'c'`.
  - `charSet = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`, `maxLength = 3`.

- **Step 4 (`j = 3`, `currentChar = 'a'`)**:
  - `'a'` already in `charSet`.
  - Remove `'a'` (at `Array[i]`) from `charSet`, increment `i` to `1`.
  - Add `'a'` back to `charSet`.
  - `charSet = {'b', 'c', 'a'}`, `maxLength = 3`.

- **Continue until the end**:
  - Adjust `i` as necessary to maintain unique characters in `charSet`.
  - The longest substring without repeating characters is `"abc"` with a length of 3.

#### Output:
`maxLength = 3`

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Each character is processed at most twice (once added and once removed from `charSet`).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The `HashSet` stores at most \(n\) unique characters.

---

### Key Observations:
1. The `while` loop ensures the window always has unique characters.
2. The two pointers (`i` and `j`) dynamically adjust the window size for optimal results.
3. Efficiently uses \(O(n)\) time by processing each character once.
