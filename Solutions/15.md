Here is an explanation of every step in the code, along with how it contributes to solving the **3Sum problem**:

---

### **Step 1: Sort the Array**
```java
Arrays.sort(nums);
```
- Sorting the array helps simplify the logic of finding triplets because:
  - Numbers are ordered, so we can use the two-pointer technique efficiently.
  - If the sum is too small, increasing the smaller number will make the sum larger.
  - If the sum is too large, decreasing the larger number will make the sum smaller.

---

### **Step 2: Use a Set to Store Unique Triplets**
```java
Set<List<Integer>> ans = new HashSet<>();
```
- A `HashSet` is used to ensure that we store only unique triplets. 
- Even if we find duplicate triplets during the iteration (e.g., [âˆ’1, 0, 1] multiple times), the `Set` will only keep one copy.
- Each triplet is stored as a `List<Integer>`.

---

### **Step 3: Iterate Over the Array**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
```
- The outer loop runs from the beginning of the array to the third-last element (`nums.length - 2`) because:
  - Each triplet consists of three numbers, and we need at least two numbers after `i` to form a triplet.
- `nums[i]` is the first number in the triplet.

---

### **Step 4: Use Two Pointers to Find Valid Triplets**
#### **Initialize Two Pointers**
```java
int p1 = i + 1;          // Pointer for the second number
int p2 = nums.length - 1; // Pointer for the third number
```
- `p1` starts just after `i` (at `i + 1`), and `p2` starts at the end of the array (`nums.length - 1`).
- These pointers will "sandwich" the array between them and help find the remaining two numbers for the triplet.

---

#### **While Loop for Two-Pointer Traversal**
```java
while (p1 < p2) {
```
- This loop continues as long as the two pointers (`p1` and `p2`) do not cross each other.
- The goal is to find combinations of `nums[i] + nums[p1] + nums[p2]` that equal zero.

---

#### **Calculate the Sum**
```java
int sum = nums[i] + nums[p1] + nums[p2];
```
- Calculate the sum of the current triplet.

---

#### **Case 1: Sum Equals Zero**
```java
if (sum == 0) {
    ans.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[p1], nums[p2]));
    p1++; // Move the second pointer forward
}
```
- If the sum equals zero:
  - A valid triplet is found, so add it to the `Set`.
  - Use `Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[p1], nums[p2])` to create a list representing the triplet.
  - Move `p1` forward to explore other possible combinations.

---

#### **Case 2: Sum Less Than Zero**
```java
else if (sum < 0) {
    p1++; // Sum too small, move the left pointer forward
}
```
- If the sum is less than zero:
  - The sum needs to increase, so move the `p1` pointer forward to a larger number.

---

#### **Case 3: Sum Greater Than Zero**
```java
else {
    p2--; // Sum too large, move the right pointer backward
}
```
- If the sum is greater than zero:
  - The sum needs to decrease, so move the `p2` pointer backward to a smaller number.

---

### **Step 5: Convert the Set to a List and Return**
```java
return new ArrayList<>(ans);
```
- The `Set` containing unique triplets is converted into a `List` using `new ArrayList<>(ans)`.
- This ensures the result is in the desired format: a `List` of `List<Integer>`.

---

### **Key Points in the Code Flow**
1. Sorting the array allows efficient use of the two-pointer technique.
2. The outer loop iterates over each number (`nums[i]`) as the first number of a potential triplet.
3. The two-pointer approach (`p1` and `p2`) efficiently finds the other two numbers for the triplet.
4. Using a `Set` ensures that duplicate triplets are not included in the final result.
5. The function ultimately returns all unique triplets that sum to zero.

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### Input: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`
1. **Sort**: `nums = [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`
2. Start iterating (`i = 0, nums[i] = -4`):
   - `p1 = 1, p2 = 5`
   - `sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[5] = -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3`
   - Since `sum < 0`, move `p1` forward.
3. Continue this logic for all `i` values.
4. Add valid triplets: `[-1, -1, 2]` and `[-1, 0, 1]`.

#### Output: `[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`
