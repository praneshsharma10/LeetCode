This solution is an implementation of the **Dutch National Flag Algorithm** to sort an array containing three distinct values: `0`, `1`, and `2`. The algorithm ensures that all `0`s are moved to the start of the array, all `2`s are moved to the end, and all `1`s remain in the middle. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

---

### **Code Walkthrough**

#### 1. **Initialization**
```java
int left = 0;          
int right = n - 1;     
int current = 0;
```
- `left`: Pointer to place the next `0`.
- `right`: Pointer to place the next `2`.
- `current`: Pointer to traverse the array.

---

#### 2. **Main Loop**
```java
while (current <= right) { ... }
```
- The loop continues as long as `current` does not surpass `right`.

Inside the loop, the value at `nums[current]` determines the action:

---

#### 3. **Case 1: `nums[current] == 0`**
```java
if (nums[current] == 0) {
    swap(nums, left, current);
    left++;
    current++;
}
```
- If the current value is `0`, it needs to be moved to the start of the array:
  - **Swap** the element at `current` with the element at `left`.
  - Increment `left` to point to the next available position for `0`.
  - Increment `current` to move to the next element.

---

#### 4. **Case 2: `nums[current] == 1`**
```java
else if (nums[current] == 1) {
    current++;
}
```
- If the current value is `1`, it is already in the correct position:
  - Simply move to the next element by incrementing `current`.

---

#### 5. **Case 3: `nums[current] == 2`**
```java
else {
    swap(nums, right, current);
    right--;
}
```
- If the current value is `2`, it needs to be moved to the end of the array:
  - **Swap** the element at `current` with the element at `right`.
  - Decrement `right` to point to the next available position for `2`.
  - Do **not** increment `current` immediately after the swap because the new value at `current` (swapped from `right`) still needs to be processed.

---

### **Helper Method: `swap`**
```java
private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
    int temp = nums[i];
    nums[i] = nums[j];
    nums[j] = temp;
}
```
- Swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the array.

---

### **Algorithm Efficiency**

1. **Time Complexity**: 
   - \(O(n)\): Each element is visited at most once.
   
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - \(O(1)\): The algorithm uses constant extra space.

### **Example Execution**

#### Input:
```java
nums = {2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0};
```

#### Execution Steps:
1. **Initial state**:
   - `nums = {2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0}`, `left = 0`, `right = 5`, `current = 0`.

2. **First iteration** (`current = 0`):
   - `nums[0] == 2`: Swap `nums[0]` with `nums[5]`.
   - New state: `nums = {0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2}`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`, `current = 0`.

3. **Second iteration** (`current = 0`):
   - `nums[0] == 0`: Swap `nums[0]` with `nums[0]`.
   - New state: `nums = {0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2}`, `left = 1`, `right = 4`, `current = 1`.

4. **Third iteration** (`current = 1`):
   - `nums[1] == 0`: Swap `nums[1]` with `nums[1]`.
   - New state: `nums = {0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2}`, `left = 2`, `right = 4`, `current = 2`.

5. **Fourth iteration** (`current = 2`):
   - `nums[2] == 2`: Swap `nums[2]` with `nums[4]`.
   - New state: `nums = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}`, `left = 2`, `right = 3`, `current = 2`.

6. **Fifth iteration** (`current = 2`):
   - `nums[2] == 1`: Increment `current`.
   - New state: `nums = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}`, `left = 2`, `right = 3`, `current = 3`.

7. **Sixth iteration** (`current = 3`):
   - `nums[3] == 1`: Increment `current`.
   - New state: `nums = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}`, `left = 2`, `right = 3`, `current = 4`.

8. **Exit**:
   - `current > right`, so the loop ends.

#### Final Output:
```java
nums = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2};
```
